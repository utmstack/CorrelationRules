VERIFICATION RULES SUMMARY:
=========================
1. afterEvents Usage: Ensures immediate alerts (malware, threats) don't use afterEvents, 
   while pattern-based alerts (brute force, anomalies) do use afterEvents.

2. CIA Scores: Validates confidentiality, integrity, and availability scores are in range 1-3.

3. Log Patterns: Checks that index patterns match the technology (e.g., v11-log-azure-* for Azure).

4. Deduplication Logic: Ensures deduplication fields include entity-identifying fields 
   (user, host, IP) appropriate for the alert type.

5. CEL Compliance: Validates CEL expressions use safe() function and correct operators.
